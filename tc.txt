Note
In the first test case, MEX(a)=0
. If you set all elements of a
 to 0
, then MEX
 of the resulting array will be 1
, and thus will increase by one.

In the second test case, MEX(a)=1
. If we assign a value of 1
 to the elements of a
 on a subsegment from 2
 to 3
, we get an array [0,1,1,0]
 for which MEX
 is 2
, and thus is increased by one compared to the original.

It can be shown that in the third and fourth test cases it is impossible to perform an operation so that the value of MEX(a)
 increases by exactly one.
